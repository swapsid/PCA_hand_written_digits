## Principal Component Analysis on the Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set

A principal component analysis is used to extract the important information from a multivariate data set and to express this information as a set of new variables called principal components.
These new variables correspond to a linear combination of the original variables. The number of principal components generated will be less than the number of original variables. This technique is often referred to as dimensionality reduction. The identification of the principal components is based on an analysis of the correlations between the original variables.
Example: As a simple example, if two variables are correlated, they can be replaced by a principle component.

## About the Data:

Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set. This data set has 10992 instances where each instance represents a numeric digit from '0' to '9' written on a Wacom digital handwriting tablet. The data was collected by F. Alimoglu et al., who collected handwriting samples of numeric digits from 44 users on an early Wacom handwriting table. The original research was concerned with the classification accuracy of the numeric digits.
Each instance has 16 numeric features representing the shape of the digit, as drawn by a user on the tablet. And, there are 10 classes in the data set - each representing a numeric digit from 0 to 9.
